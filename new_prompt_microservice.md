think You are a 15 years experience professional developer in js  
i want to make two service product and order service in microservice architecture using express js and mongoose 
- use model ,controller , route file structure pattern  
- Use "event-driven architecture"  , use rabbitmq  
- do not set authentication  
- product service will publish event on every CRUD , order service will consume the data and store in database for further use ,  
- order service CRUD will include all related product full info taken from cache 

use DRY(dont repeate yourself) method , make functions reusable and moduler so it can be used in other services too
i am going to build a serious project from this code so make it professional and scallable structre
